	<h1>Multi-strategy quantitative hedge fund</h1>
	<p>
		QBite Capital is a multi-strategy quantitative hedge fund focusing on the digital asset markets.
	</p>
	<p>
		We use quantitative trading strategies to exploit opportunities and inefficiencies across
		centralised and decentralized crypto markets.
	</p>
	<p>We aim to provide industry-leading risk-adjusted returns to our investors.</p>
	<p>
		Our edge comes from our unique approach to the market. Using our research and development
		skills, we are able to build strategies and execution algorithms that generate returns
		irrespective of market developments. Our infrastructure includes automated trading platforms,
		advanced analytics, and a robust risk management system. While our mandate is market neutral, we
		have high flexibility in terms of product and strategy selection which allow us to adapt to the
		market and continuously exploit opportunities as they appear.
